# Random.Pcg Tests

These tests were written for 0.16 and have not been updated for 0.17. The RNG hasn't changed since they were run, so
the results should be valid, but PRs updating them are welcome.

The tests in this directory are one-off simple programs to confirm that certain functions aren't obviously wrong.
Heavyweight statistical tests are under `dieharder`. Benchmarks (using a 0.16 benchmarking lib) are in `benchmark`.
